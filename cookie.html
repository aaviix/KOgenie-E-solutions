                                        cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties.Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.This
                                        is described in more detail below. The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served
                                        may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
                                    <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
                                        categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services. The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and

                                    <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h3>
                                    <p class="p-change-cookie">Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
                                        graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitorthe traffic patterns of
                                        users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve
                                        site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
